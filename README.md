CS-465 Full Stack with MEAN

Architecture
This project is a web application for a travel agency. The customer facing side was first created with Express HTML, but then each separate page had to load. To help with the rendering speeds, we converted the code to a handlebars view, which stored all the needed information on the client, making it much quicker to load. We used JavaScript on the front and back end to add dynamic elements to the web page, which was utilized to retrieve data from MongoDB, so trips could be added and edited. SPAs, or single page applications, are web pages that load only single web documents, and then updates the content of that document through JavaScript APIs.

Functionality
	JSON is used to structure information in a way that's both human-readable and able to be parsed by machines, making it usable across various programming languages. JavaScript, on the other hand, is a programming language used on the frontend to create interactive web interfaces. JSON acts as a bridge between the frontend and backend development by providing a standardized format for data exchange. Frontend code can use JavaScript to fetch JSON data from backend servers, which allows dynamic content to update on webpages. Backend systems can convert data into JSON format to send responses to clients, which ensures seamless communication and data synchronization between the two parts.
	One instance in which code was refactored to improve functionality and efficiency was the trip card versus trip list components. Separating two components that render the same information is inefficient, each trip being rendered separately but part of the whole page works better in terms of functionality. Reusing UI components is beneficial as it decreases the overall size of the application and decreases the chances of errors and vulnerabilities.

Reflection
This course has helped a great deal in reaching professional goals. Web applications are more popular than ever today, and being able to work on one as much as we did this term was truly helpful. Also, this course was helpful in helping me decide which way I want to go in the professional world, by working on both front and backend. Skills I learned more of in this course which will help when finding jobs are how to work with different technologies and make them work together to make a good product.
